# Introduction to ArcPy

ArcPy is a Python site package provided with ArcGIS that allows you to automate geoprocessing tasks, perform spatial analysis, and manage GIS data.  
In this chapter, we introduce the basics of ArcPy and how it integrates with ArcGIS.

---

## ArcPy Site Package

ArcPy provides access to all geoprocessing tools available in ArcGIS.  
With ArcPy, you can:  

- Perform **spatial analysis** (buffer, clip, overlay, etc.)  
- Automate **map production**  
- Access and manipulate **GIS datasets**  
- Build **custom workflows**  

```{python}
import arcpy

# Check ArcPy installation details
info = arcpy.GetInstallInfo()
print("ArcPy Version:", info["Version"])
print("Product Name:", info["ProductName"])
```

---

## ArcGIS Geoprocessing Tools in Python

Every geoprocessing tool in ArcGIS can be used in Python through ArcPy.  
The naming convention is usually: `ToolName_toolboxAlias`.  

Example: Buffer tool (`arcpy.Buffer_analysis`)  

```{python}
import arcpy

# Example: create a buffer
arcpy.env.workspace = r"C:\GIS_Data"
arcpy.Buffer_analysis("roads.shp", "roads_buffer.shp", "1000 Meters")
print("Buffer created successfully!")
```

---

## The arcpy.env Workspace & Overwriting Outputs

The **workspace** is the default folder or geodatabase where ArcPy looks for input data and stores output data.  
The **overwriteOutput** environment setting allows you to overwrite existing outputs.  

```{python}
import arcpy

# Set the workspace
arcpy.env.workspace = r"C:\GIS_Data"

# Allow overwriting of outputs
arcpy.env.overwriteOutput = True

# Example: dissolve polygons
arcpy.Dissolve_management("villages.shp", "villages_dissolved.shp")
print("Dissolve completed!")
```

---

## Getting Tool Documentation

ArcPy provides access to help/documentation for tools.  
This is useful to understand input parameters and usage.  

```{python}
import arcpy

# Get documentation for the Buffer tool
help(arcpy.Buffer_analysis)

# Another way: open ArcGIS Pro documentation
# In ArcGIS Pro, search "Buffer (Analysis)" in Geoprocessing Pane
```

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned:  
- What **ArcPy** is and why it is useful.  
- How to use ArcGIS **geoprocessing tools** with Python.  
- How to configure `arcpy.env` settings.  
- How to access **tool documentation**.  

---

## Exercise

Try the following tasks:  

1. Use the `Clip_analysis` tool in ArcPy to clip one shapefile with another.  
2. Write a script that dissolves a shapefile and saves the output with a new name.  
3. Explore the documentation of any tool (e.g., `Intersect_analysis`) using `help()`.
